An *issue tracking system* often also contains a knowledge base containing information on each\ncustomer, resolutions to common problems, and other such data. \n\n###Ticket\nA **ticket** element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report on a particular problem, its **status**,\nand other relevant data. A ticket element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report on a particular problem,\nits status, and other relevant data.\n\n###Workflow\n"
