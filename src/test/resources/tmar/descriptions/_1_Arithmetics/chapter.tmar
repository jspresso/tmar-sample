Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek ἀριθμός arithmos, "number") is the oldest
and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists in the study of numbers,
especially the properties of the traditional operations between them — addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division. 

Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered 
to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, 
geometry, and analysis. 

The terms arithmetic and higher arithmetic were used until the beginning of the 20th 
century as synonyms for number theory and are, sometimes, still used to refer to a 
wider part of number theory
