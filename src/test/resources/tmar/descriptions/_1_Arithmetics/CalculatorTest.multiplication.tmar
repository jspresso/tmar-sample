The multiplication of two whole numbers is equivalent to the addition of one of them with itself as many times as the value of the other one; 

for example, 3 multiplied by 4 (often said as "3 times 4") can be calculated by adding 4 copies of 3 together:
    3 x 4 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12

Four bags of three marbles gives twelve marbles (4 x 3 = 12) :
