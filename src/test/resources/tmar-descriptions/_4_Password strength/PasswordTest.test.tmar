Password strength checker 

Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting guessing and brute-force attacks. 
In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, 
on average, to guess it correctly. 
 
_The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, and unpredictability.

_What is a strong password?

With the above mentioned in mind, I should stress that a sufficiently strong password does not necessarily need to fulfill 
all of the rules below, but merely a few will do. Consider the following rules to each add an extra point in how strong the 
password is (so that 0 point is the weakest, and 4 is the strongest). UI-patterns.com defines a strong password when it

 * Rule A : Has more than 8 characters
 * Rule B : Contains both small and uppercase letters
 * Rule C : Contains at least one numerical character 
 * Rule D : Contains special characters like ~!@#$%^&*_-+='\(){}:;"'<>,.?/() etc. 

 _This would result in 5 levels of password strength depending on how many of the above mentioned criteria are being met.
 
 Here are some examples :
 
 /each 
 [ password   | A?    | B?    | C?    | D?    | score? | strength? |
 | DEMO       | false | false | false | false | 0      | weak      |
 | password   | false | false | false | false | 0      | weak      |
 | demo1      | false | false | true  | false | 1      | weak      |
 | 123a       | false | false | true  | false | 1      | weak      |
 | Password   | false | true  | false | false | 1      | weak      |
 | abcdefghi  | true  | false | false | false | 1      | weak      |
 | Password   | false | true  | false | false | 1      | weak      |
 | $          | false | false | false | true  | 1      | weak      |

 Now some more  FAIR paswords :
 
 | Demo1      | false | true  | true  | false | 2      | fair      |
 | password0  | true  | false | true  | false | 2      | fair      |
 | demo1*     | false | false | true  | true  | 2      | fair      |
 
 Now some GOOD passwords :
 | Demo1$     | false | true  | true  | true  | 3      | good      |
 | Password0  | true  | true  | true  | false | 3      | good      |
 | BIgdeal@me | true  | true  | false | true  | 3      | good      |

 Now some STRONG passwords :

 | Hell0w0rd! | true  | true  | true  | true  | 4      | strong    |
 | P@ssword0  | true  | true  | true  | true  | 4      | strong    |
 | 4You&Me!!  | true  | true  | true  | true  | 4      | strong    |
