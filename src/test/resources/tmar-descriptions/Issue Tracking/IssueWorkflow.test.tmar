Issue lifecycle 

_Purpose
An issue tracking system is a computer software package that manages and maintains lists of issues, as needed by 
an organization. An issue tracking system often also contains a knowledge base containing information on each 
customer, resolutions to common problems, and other such data. 

_Ticket
A ticket element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report on a particular problem, its status, and other 
relevant data. A ticket element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report on a particular problem, its status, 
and other relevant data.

_Workflow
An example scenario is presented to demonstrate how a common issue tracking system would work:
 * A customer service technician receives a telephone call  (i.e NEW issue) from a customer about a problem. 
 * The technician creates the issue in the system entering all relevant data  (i.e the issue is ACKNOWLEDGED)
 * As work is done on that issue, the system is updated with new data by the technician (i.e ASSIGNED). 
 * After the issue has been fully addressed, it is marked as RESOLVED in the tracking system.
 * If the problem is not fully resolved, the ticket will be reopened (i.e FEEDBACK) once the technician receives 
  new information from the customer. 
 * Few days after a ticket was marked as resolved, the status will be CLOSED.

Here is a description of all possible status and transitions :

_Transitions 
The issue tracking system should allow only transitions bellow :
/each 
[ state        | acknowledged? | confirmed? | assigned? | frozen? | resolved? | feedback? | closed? |
| new          | true          | true       | true      | no      | no        | no        | no      |
| acknowledged | no            | true       | true      | no      | no        | no        | no      |
| confirmed    | no            | no         | true      | no      | no        | no        | no      |
| assigned     | no            | true       | no        | true    | true      | true      | no      |
| frozen       | no            | no         | true      | no      | no        | no        | no      |
| resolved     | no            | no         | no        | no      | no        | true      | true    |
| feedback     | no            | no         | true      | no      | no        | no        | no      |
| closed       | no            | no         | no        | no      | false     | true      | no      |

The should be no transition from any transition to the "new" status :

[ state        | new? |
| acknowledged | no   |
| confirmed    | no   |
| assigned     | no   |
| frozen       | no   |
| resolved     | no   |
| feedback     | no   |
| closed       | no   |
