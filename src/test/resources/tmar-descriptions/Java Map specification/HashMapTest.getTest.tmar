Algorithm for map - get

A map should be an object that maps keys to values.

Let's consider this map :
   /table sample 1 
  [ key | value |
  | A   | 10    |
  | B   | 20    |
  | C   | 30    |
  | D   | 30    |
 
  This operation returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, 
  or null if this map contains no mapping for the key. 

  Here are few examples; for each line bellow let's "get" the value for the sample
  map above, and check the expected value :
     /each 
   [ key | expected value ? | Note                       
   | A   | 10               | This value exists          
   | B   | 20               | This value exists          
   | X   | null             | This value does not exists 
  
   For more details about "null" value, see the put operation test case.
